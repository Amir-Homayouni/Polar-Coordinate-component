The polar coordinate is a two-dimensional coordinate system, In this system, two parameters have a role, the first refers to the distance between a reference point and a point on a plane and the second is about the angle from a reference direction.

we used this system to make a component in Rhino-grasshopper that enable us to mapping geometry from the base boundary to a target geometry.
